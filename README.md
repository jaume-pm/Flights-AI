# Flights-AI Research Project

Welcome to my research project for the Data Mining (MIDA) subject at UPC.

## Objective
The primary aim of my research was to develop a classification model capable of predicting flight disruptions (such as delays or cancellations) based solely on the information available to travelers when booking their flights months in advance.

## Dataset
The original dataset used in this research contained all the domestic flights of the USA in 2015. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv).

## Key Findings
Here are the key discoveries from my research:
- **Scheduled Departure Time:** Flights departing later in the day tend to experience more disruptions compared to those in the morning.
- **Low-Cost Airlines:** Surprisingly, there is no significant correlation between low-cost airlines and flight delays.
- **Unpredictable Factors:** Factors such as meteorological conditions or strikes, which greatly influence flight disruptions, are often unknown months in advance.

## Best Model
After rigorous analysis, the Support Vector Machine of third degree emerged as the best model for classifying disrupted flights. While it exhibited similar accuracy to the second-degree model, its average F1 score between the two classes was notably higher.
